Editing Hosts file

In the first column **IP-address** you must enter a valid IP address (eg. ``127.0.0.1``), in the second **Hostname**, the hostname (eg. ``localhost``), and in the third **Comment** -- optional comment, if necessary. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

Multiple hostnames are allowed in one entry. Use a space as a separator. Quotation marks or wildcards are strictly prohibited. Inline commentaries are also forbidden. Use a separate column for this.
